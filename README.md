Created 4 more possible ideas for my project these are as follows:
<br>
<br>
Recording lighter
<br>
Concept: create a small recording device and attach it to a lighter which will be triggered by the flame being lit. Possibly compile these recordings into one track or have the lighter as the sonic art piece itself 
<br>
Reason: shows how much time is wasted smoking 
<br>
Possible issues: Ethical recording in public issues, technical issues e.g getting the recording device to record and finding a way to stop it recording.
<br>
Research has shown that smoking reduces life expectancy by seven to eight years. On average, each cigarette shortens your life anywhere from seven to eleven minutes.
Exchanging life for 10 minutes of smoking i.e. not doing much
<br>
<br>
Clouds  
Concept: use the attached images which I have compiled over time and process them through software which takes images/ colours and turns them into sound data.
<br>
I will then possibly record outdoor/open spaces and uses these sounds as ‘instrumentation’ for the data that I have received form the images.
<br>
Reason: create music/sounds from the ‘invisible’ sounds that constantly surround us outdoors  
Possible issues: narrowing down image selection, receiving useful data which can be used to create music. 
<br>
<br> 
Thunderstorm
<br>
Concept: This will be an installation piece where I play a video of a thunderstorm. There will be a sensor set up in front of the screen, the distance a person is standing from the sensor will decide on the velocity and volume of the thunder sound.
<br>
Extension on idea: use multiple sensors and multiple speakers to create a surround sound experience, use lighting to create a more immersive experience  
Reason: create an audio visual piece that stems from the idea of the speed of light and sound 
<br>
Possible issues: technical issues with sensors, finding a suitable location to house this piece
<br>
<br>
Trees
<br>
Concept: The final outcome of this project will be silent. I will take multiple field recordings of trees and their surround areas. I shall then take a picture of the landscape which includes trees. The trees will be removed from the image and replaced by the images of the sound waves from the field recordings.
<br>
Extension on idea: re-create the whole landscape image using images of sound waves of recordings of each element in the image 
<br>
Reason: show how sound can be can be seen and exist within landscapes.
<br>
Possible issues: uncertainty of how the sound waves are going to look and if there is even a possibility of recreating the image with sound waves.

I discovered that the idea for my current project is going to be more technical than I first thought due to not being able to translate the noises birds are making.  
<br> 
to do
<br>
Come up with multiple ideas for project and try to narrow it down to one
<br>

<br>
looked into using nature as part of my project, specifically using bird sounds. My idea is to record the sound of birds in their natural habitat and then to play back the recording at a later date to see if they will respond to the sound of their own voice.
<br>
to do
<br>
research the technicalities of my current project idea to see how realisitic it is.

<br>
conducted research looking into what sonic art is and projects that have been created in the past. 
<br>
to do
<br>
research more sonic art pieces and begin to think about ideas for my own project.
