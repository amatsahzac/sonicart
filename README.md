Created 4 more possible ideas for my project these are as follows:
<br>
<br>
Recording lighter
<br>
<br>
Concept: create a small recording device and attach it to a lighter which will be triggered by the flame being lit. Possibly compile these recordings into one track or have the lighter as the sonic art piece itself 
<br>
<br>
Reason: shows how much time is wasted smoking 
<br>
<br>
Possible issues: Ethical recording in public issues, technical issues e.g getting the recording device to record and finding a way to stop it recording.
<br>
<br>
Research has shown that smoking reduces life expectancy by seven to eight years. On average, each cigarette shortens your life anywhere from seven to eleven minutes.
Exchanging life for 10 minutes of smoking i.e. not doing much
<br>
<br>
Clouds
<br>  
<br>
Concept: use the attached images which I have compiled over time and process them through software which takes images/ colours and turns them into sound data.
<br>
<br>  
I will then possibly record outdoor/open spaces and uses these sounds as ‘instrumentation’ for the data that I have received form the images.
<br>  
<br>
Reason: create music/sounds from the ‘invisible’ sounds that constantly surround us outdoors  
<br>
<br>  
Possible issues: narrowing down image selection, receiving useful data which can be used to create music.

I discovered that the idea for my current project is going to be more technical than I first thought due to not being able to translate the noises birds are making.  
<br> 
to do
<br>
Come up with multiple ideas for project and try to narrow it down to one
<br>

looked into using nature as part of my project, specifically using bird sounds. My idea is to record the sound of birds in their natural habitat and then to play back the recording at a later date to see if they will respond to the sound of their own voice.
<br>
to do
<br>
research the technicalities of my current project idea to see how realisitic it is.

<br>
conducted research looking into what sonic art is and projects that have been created in the past. 
<br>
to do
<br>
research more sonic art pieces and begin to think about ideas for my own project.
