This project is an interactive piece which aims to get its audience back in touch with nature.
The piece focusses on the pollution that humanity has brought into this world both in terms of industrial pollution and the 
noise that industrial pollution causes.    

My sonic art piece will be in the form of an interactive physical picture.
The image will be a silhouette of a landscape which includes trees, a train track on a bridge, lights from a lamppost and houses with lights on.
The picture was taken at night down by the river therefore there is a reflection of part of the landscape in the water.
This reflection makes the silhouette landscape look like the shape of a waveform, I am going to edit this picture on photoshop to make the whole landscape reflect and look like a waveform. 

The piece will be made interactive through conductive paint. I shall print off the image and add either card or ply wood to the back for support. 
The paint will then be applied over the wave form landscape and dark parts of the image. 
I shall be using an Adafruit Audio FX Mini Soundboard to play sounds through. 
The soundboard is capable of playing 8 sounds therefore I shall divide the image into different sections, each will play a different sound depending on what the silhouette depicts. 
From left to right the landscape starts with just trees and then moves onto a train bridge and then houses. 

The meaning behind the piece is that humanity is taking away the nature that we have left in the world.
The sounds will get louder the further right you press on the picture due to the image looking like a waveform that gets bigger towards the end. 
The volume also represents how the world was once quiet and peaceful with just fields and trees but humanity has built trains and houses which cause noise pollution
